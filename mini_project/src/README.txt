This is the library mini project.
The library is the class that manages the users, the books and the events.
There are regular users and premium users that can borrow books at different rates.
The admins can manipulate the library, the users, the books, the events and the bookings.
They can add, read, update and delete any of the above in various ways.
The event class is a class of events that can be booked by the users.
Each event has a name, a date, and a number of seats available, while also managing the current number of seats booked.
The booking class is a class of bookings that tie the user and the event together, with a start and end date.
